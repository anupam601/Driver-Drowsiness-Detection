 Driver drowsiness is a hazardous condition characterized by excessive tiredness or sleepiness while operating a vehicle. It poses a significant risk to road safety as it impairs a driver's reaction time, attention, and decision-making abilities, increasing the likelihood of accidents. Causes of drowsiness can include lack of sleep, long hours of driving, sleep disorders, medication side effects, alcohol consumption, and shift work. Recognizing signs of drowsiness such as yawning, heavy eyelids, drifting between lanes, and difficulty recalling recent moments is crucial. To prevent drowsy driving, drivers should prioritize getting enough sleep, taking breaks during long trips, avoiding late-night driving, and refraining from substances that induce drowsiness. Technology, such as driver drowsiness detection systems, can provide warnings and alerts to drivers. By prioritizing safety and being vigilant, we can reduce the risks associated with driver drowsiness and ensure safer roads for everyone.
